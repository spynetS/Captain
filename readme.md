To see our progress visit the Project page's [KanbanBoard](https://github.com/users/spynetS/projects/18).


### Running and compiling
While developing the game we will just play the game through the unity game engine, which will let us run the game. When the game is finished for release we will
use unity's build system which will compile and build everything necessary for an executable file.

# How to run the unit tests
The unit tests can be run trough the test runner in the unity editor. The test runner will show if the tests fail or succeeds. It will also describe any issues if the tests would 

# Code coverage
To generate code coverage one can start a new code coverage report in the unity editor. Then run the unit tests and then stop the report. This will generate an report at */CodeCoverage* folder.

# Run a linter
There is an built in linter for visual studio which will work if the unity packages are installed correctly.
